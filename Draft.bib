  abstract = {Sobel is one of the most popular edge detection operators used in image processing. To date, most users utilize the two-directional 3×3 Sobel operator as detectors because of its low computational cost and reasonable performance. Simultaneously, many studies have been conducted on using large multi-directional Sobel operators to satisfy their needs considering the high stability, but at an expense of speed. This paper proposes a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) kernel for the four-directional 5×5 Sobel operator. To improve kernel performance, we implement the kernel based on warp-level primitives, which can significantly reduce the number of memory accesses. In addition, we introduce the prefetching mechanism and operator transformation into the kernel to significantly reduce the computational complexity and data transmission latency. Compared with the OpenCV-GPU library, our kernel shows high performances of 6.7x speedup on a Jetson AGX Xavier GPU and 13x on a GTX 1650Ti GPU.}

  abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image captures the high-resolution microstructure of a material. Segmentation of SEM image delineates and separates distinct components in the image. We tested an automated SEM-image segmentation workflow involving feature extraction followed by machine learning. For each pixel in the SEM image, 16 features are generated and then fed to a random forest classifier to determine the presence of four rock components, namely, (1) pore/crack; (2) rock matrix including clay, calcite, and quartz; (3) pyrite; and (4) organic/kerogen components. The most important features for the desired segmentation are wavelet transforms, Gaussian blur, and difference of Gaussians. The random forest classifier was trained using only 705, 2074, 17,373, and 15,000 pixels for the pore/crack, organic/kerogen, rock matrix, and pyrite components, respectively. For purposes of validation of the segmentation method, 5121, 4725, 4815, and 4775 pixels were used for the pore/crack, organic/kerogen, rock matrix, and pyrite components, respectively. The performance of the trained classifier, quantified in terms of overall F1 score, on the validation dataset was higher than 0.9. The newly developed method is significantly more reliable and robust in comparison with the popular histogram thresholding and object-based segmentation methods, especially for the matrix and pyrite components in shale samples.}
